img2cbr
=======

A simple utility to create a cbr file from a list of image files.

The script depends on miebach's [lib-rar-python](https://github.com/miebach/lib-rar-python). There's a [pull request](https://github.com/miebach/lib-rar-python/pull/3) that adds Python 3 compatibility. However, it is not yet accepted. If you want to use Python 3, there is a [fork](https://github.com/Alternhuman/lib-rar-python) you can use.
